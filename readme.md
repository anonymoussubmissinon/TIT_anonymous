## Overview
This is the official implementation of Transformer in Transformer (TIT) as Backbone for Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Code: 
1) The two folders, DT_TIT and PPO_TIT_and_CQL_TIT, contain the old version; 
2) The two folders, RL_Foundation_Mujoco_including_DT_MGDT_GATO_and_TIT and RLFoundation_BabyAI_including_DT_GATO_and_TIT, contain the new version; 
3) **We recommend the readers to use the new version, which has a satisfactory performance and good file structure (thus, is easy to modify to design new algorithms).
